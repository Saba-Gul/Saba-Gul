### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Saba Gul, a passionate Data Scientist with a strong background in AI and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in applying these technologies to solve real-world problems in healthcare, smart grids, and urban safety. 

In my previous role at the National Center of Artificial Intelligence, I led groundbreaking research projects on topics like air pollution forecasting and real-time theft detection. I'm also proficient in building and deploying computer vision systems for tasks like social distancing detection and smart parking.

I'm currently the Founder of Serin In Tech, where I'm using my expertise to empower others through workshops and educational initiatives.

This GitHub profile showcases my experience and technical skills. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!
